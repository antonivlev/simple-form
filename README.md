# Netsells technical test

To run:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
This program implements [this brief](https://github.com/netsells/frontend-engineer-technical-test). This is not a completed implementation, it is functional but the layout still needs adjusting. I have marked remaining things with TODOs.

## Why no frameworks? 

I have decided not to use any frontend frameworks on purpose. At my current job we are quite framework heavy: we use React with SCSS, and Webpack for bundling. 

However, I have often wondered why exactly we are using these tools. What advantages do they offer? Are they worth the drawbacks e.g. the browser loading code you've not written? 

Therefore, I have decided to use this test as an opportunity, to see whether vanilla HTML/CSS/JS code can be just as clean and maintainable, as with frameworks.

Having said that I am of course happy to adopt whatever frameworks you are using at Netsells.
